# Python

## Installation

You can use variety of python environment managers, but we recommend Anaconda with Python 3.6+
or using pure system python.

**Use Python3.6+ and be careful, that you are actually using it**

Inside the `python` directory, run:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Code style / formatting

Setup your IDE to 4 spaces indentation.

## Run the tests

```
python -m unittest tests/*.py
```
# Run experiment

Just run in the python folder
```
python main.py
```

## Using visualization tool

You can use [visualisation tool for HTM systems](https://github.com/htm-community/HTMpandaVis).
